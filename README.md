#  SimpleRental Move Smart Contract

##  Project Description
**SimpleRental** is a minimal Aptos Move smart contract that enables property owners to list rentals and renters to securely pay rent in **AptosCoin**.  
The contract contains **only two functions**:
1. **`create_rental`** â€” Allows the property owner to create a rental listing with a fixed rent amount.
2. **`rent_property`** â€” Allows a renter to pay the rent to the owner and occupy the property.

This simple design makes it ideal for educational purposes, small-scale decentralized rental platforms, and testing Move programming concepts.

##  Vision
Our goal is to **simplify blockchain-based property rentals** by creating a transparent, trustless, and secure way for owners and renters to interact directly â€” without middlemen.

Key principles:
- Simplicity
- Security
- Transparency
- Low transaction costs

---

##  Future Scope
Planned improvements and new features:
- **Rental expiry date** â€” Automatically free up the property after the rental period ends.
- **Multiple rental units** â€” Let owners manage multiple listings under one account.
- **Partial payments & deposits** â€” Support security deposits and monthly payments.
- **Review system** â€” Owners and renters can rate each other.
- **Integration with Web3 UI** â€” Connect to a frontend DApp for easy use.
